### 1. What is your project, and what problem does it solve? (max 100 words)
Hedra Labs Joint Mining is an easy-to-use [Filecoin storage mining](https://github.com/reference/filecoin-storage-miners) platform where mining activists could join Filecoin storage mining to earn FIL(a cryptocurrency that powers the Filecoin network) SAO Network by intuitive operation. With a strong technical know-how in the development and operations of Filecoin storage mining, the core team of SAO Network has empowered Joint Mining that allows users to join the mining business to earn FIL (a cryptocurrency that powers the Filecoin network) by staking FIL and obtaining a certain amount of storage power shares. We call it “stake-to-earn”.

### 3. a) How is IPFS, Filecoin, or related technology used in this project? (max 200 words)

The joint mining project is now mainly used by SAO Network, with the help of joint mining tool SAO Network can store data in Filecoin across products, for example Data Store, which is a product of SAO Network, providing an easy-to-use storage pattern of any data including files, pictures, videos, music, digital artworks, and data backup, etc. 

We plan to adopt FVM in joint mining tool, after that every miner can use our tool to enlarge their mining activity.
